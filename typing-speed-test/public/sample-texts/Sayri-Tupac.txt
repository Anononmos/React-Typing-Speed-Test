In October of 1557 Sayri Tupac left Vilcabamba with a large entourage and at great expense to travel to Lima to meet Viceroy Lope Garcia de Castro. The Inca then returned to Cuzco, where he received a spectacular welcoming by the indigenous people, and took up residency in Yucay. Sayri Tupac and his sister/wife Cusi Huarcay were baptized, and, as part of a previously signed treaty, dispensation was granted so that they could marry (figure 1.3). The departure of Sayri Tupac from Vilcabamba and the establishment of an accord between him and the Spaniards did not, however, bring much relief to the crown since Sayri Tupac died only a few years later (ca. 1560).
